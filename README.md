# Face Attendance System Project

## Overview

The Face Attendance System is a project that combines computer vision, machine learning, and real-time database management to create an automated attendance tracking system using facial recognition. This system detects and recognizes faces from images or video streams and maintains attendance records in a real-time database.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition using libraries such as dlib, cv2 (OpenCV), and face_recognition.
- Integration with a real-time database to store and manage attendance records.
- Machine learning algorithms for facial feature recognition and identification.
- User-friendly interface for capturing images or video streams and processing attendance data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (dlib, cv2, face_recognition, etc.): Provide installation instructions or requirements.txt file.
- Real-time database (e.g., Firebase) setup: Provide setup instructions if applicable.
